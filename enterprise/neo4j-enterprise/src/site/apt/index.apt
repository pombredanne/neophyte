Neo4j Enterprise

    This is a meta package containing the most commonly used Neo4j libraries,
    which means that it enables you to add these as a single {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}}
    dependency in your projects. Using this package, you're also sure that you use
    component versions that fit together.
    
    The Neo4j Enterprise Edition adds online backup and High Availability clustering on top of Neo4j Advanced Edition (which in turn adds advanced monitoring on top of Neo4j Community Edition).

    To see what's included, have a look at the {{{./dependencies.html}dependencies}}.
    
    See the {{{http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/tutorials-java-embedded-setup.html}Neo4j Manual}} for further information.
