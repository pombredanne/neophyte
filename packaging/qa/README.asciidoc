Neo4j Server QA
===============

These QA tests exercise the server from a user perspective, consuming and
exercising the publicly available artifacts. The QA tests are broken into
indivdual "features" written using Cucumber BDD. Look in the `features`
subdirectory to see all the tests.

Requirements
------------

Full Ruby development environment:

* ruby 1.8.7+
* rubygems 
* rvm (recommended, but optional)

Gems:

* cucumber - for running QA tests

Build & Test
------------

With maven (first time):

  mvn -Dcucumber.installGems=true integration-test

With maven (subequent times):

  export DOWNLOAD_LOCATION=file:///path/to/neo4j-enterprise-1.5-SNAPSHOT-unix.tar.gz && export NEO4J_VERSION=1.5-SNAPSHOT && mvn clean integration-test
  mvn integration-test

To run only a particular feature:

  mvn integration-test -Dcucumber.features=features/download-and-unpack.feature

Pragmatic guide
---------------

  mvn clean package

<copy to local web server> or “sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80” in the target /directory
OR set an environmentnt variable to point at a built tarball/zip

  export DOWNLOAD_LOCATION=file:///home/user/pointing/to/local/neo4j.tgz
  export NEO4J_VERSION=1.5-SNAPSHOT
  export NEO4J_PRODUCT={community|advanced|enterprise}

  cd ../qa

If you haven’t installed a bunch of JRuby gems that Cucumber needs, then this magic is necessary:
mvn -Dcucumber.installGems=true clean integration-test

Otherwise just

  mvn clean integration-test

after the above, there should be 6 artifacts in the the target/ directory of the standalone project, one for each of {unix,windows}x{community,advanced,enterprise}
Pick your poison and check.
